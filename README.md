# matfbpop
One-time showing Facebook "Like Page" popup.
This little script makes it really easier to add a popup splash Facebook like page to your website.
What you only need to do is copying the code from code.html and changing "facebook.com/xmatsiyah" url with yours.
And adding it to your website, of course :)
